# intelliPet
Fun project to develop an intelligent pet with cognivtive abilities.

### Idea:
Develop a quadcopter with cognitive abilities using a low cost computer like Raspberry Pi. We call it a Picopter from here.

### Picopter abilities and technologies used:
Entity or Ability | Description or technology used
------------ | -------------
Device and OS | Quadcopter + Raspberry Pi + Linux 
Programming language  | C/C++
Perception - Vision | Computer Vision (e.g. libraries [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/), [DLib](http://dlib.net/) etc.)
Learning & Memory | Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Genetic Algorithm
Navigation & Localization | 3D cognitive map of the world for map matching, Computer vision for generating point clouds for 3D world etc.
Control and Connectivity | Using mobile or web application to control and instruct the Picopter with for example Bluetooth connection. Maybe use a [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) development environment. 


### Use cases:
Area | Possible use case
------------ | -------------
Agriculture | Crop survey and analysis with visual computing
Smart home (Internet Of Things) | With similar device development skills
