# intelliPet
Fun project to develop an intelligent pet with cognitive abilities.

### Idea:
Develop a quadcopter with cognitive abilities using a low cost computer like Raspberry Pi. We call it a Picopter from here.

### Picopter abilities and technologies used:
Entity or Ability | Description or technology used
------------ | -------------
Device and OS | Quadcopter + Raspberry Pi + Linux 
Programming language  | C/C++
Perception - Vision | Computer Vision (practice machine vision in this [playground](https://github.com/roshanpoudyal/machine_vision_application.git))
Learning & Memory | Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Genetic Algorithm
Navigation & Localization | 3D cognitive map of the world for map matching, Computer vision for generating point clouds for 3D world etc.
Control and Connectivity | Using mobile or web application to control and instruct the Picopter with for example Bluetooth connection. Maybe use a [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) development environment. 


### Use cases:
Area | Possible use case
------------ | -------------
Agriculture | Crop survey and analysis with visual computing
Smart home (Internet Of Things) | With similar device development skills

### Getting started:
1. Here is a course in edx from TUM Munich on [Autonomous Navigation for Flying Robots](https://www.edx.org/course/autonomous-navigation-flying-robots-tumx-autonavx-0) which is adopted from [their own university MOOC course](https://www.tum.de/en/about-tum/news/press-releases/detail/article/31494/).

### AI and Machine learning resources:
1. [Deep Learning and AI tutorials,Courses, lectures, videos, Papers, Researhers, Websites,Datasets, Apps, companies, projects and communities](https://www.leadingindia.ai/resources/).
2. Learn fundamental concepts of machine learning and statistics concepts from [Statquest channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtYLUTtgS3k1Fg4y5tAhLbw).
3. Nice [introduction to Neural networks](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi) from 3Blue1Brown on youtube.
